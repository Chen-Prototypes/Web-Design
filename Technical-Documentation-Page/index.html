            <p>The Bifrost is a cool as heck legendary staff in Guild Wars 2, it's known for its unique visual effects
                and has been sought after by many players for its rarity and prestige. In this technical documentation,
                we will be going over the some details and tips of The Bifrost's creation and how to obtain it. If you
                want the specifics see the <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Bifrost">wiki</a>.</p>
            <p>To create The Bifrost, players must obtain its precursor, The Legend, and combine it with other materials
                through a complex crafting process. The journey to obtain The Bifrost is a long one, but the reward is
                well worth the effort.</p>
            <p>Let's dive into the details.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Materials">
            <header>Materials</header>
            <p>Creating The Bifrost requires the following materials:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 The Legend (Precursor)</li>
                <li>1 Gift of Mastery</li>
                <li>1 Gift of Fortune</li>
                <li>1 Gift of the Bifrost</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Some of these materials require specific crafting skills or purchased with in-game currency. It is
                important to plan ahead and gather the necessary materials before embarking on the journey to create The
                Bifrost. For </p>

            <p>The precursor for The Bifrost is called The Legend, and it can be obtained through various means,
                including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Having it randomly drop from any bag/chest/container that can drop exotic gear or the randomly
                    obtaining it through the Mystic Forge</li>
                <li>Completing the associated Legendary Weapons collection achievement for The Bifrost.</li>
                <li>Purchasing it from the trading post.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is highly recommended that you simply buy The Legend off the trading post, as obtaining the precursor
                otherwise can take a very long time through the quests or will require extremely high luck through
                containers/Mystic Forge .</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Gift_of_Mastery">
            <header>Gift of Mastery</header>
            <p> The Gift of Mastery (GOM) has 2 main parts.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Gift of Exploration</li>
                <li>Gift of Battle</li>
            </ol>
            <p> Both components take a fair amount of time. The Gift of Exploration oftens puts people off from trying
                to make their own legendary because it requires you to get 100% Core Tyria map completion (no expansion
                stuff or living world maps). Most people don't find this very enjoyable and will take around 20-30 hours
                when doing optimized routing (use a map overlay, like GW2 TacO).
            <p>
            <p>The Gift of Battle can be quite annoying if you don't play World vs World (WvW), depending on your level
                and how active you are this can also take 10+ hours. This can very daunting if you don't play WvW but
                many players enjoy WvW and with a bit of effort can be quite accessible.</p>

            <header>Gift of Fortune/Bifrost </header>
            <p> I'm combining these elements because they are simply money sinks. Use GW2efficiency to calculate gold
                costs. They cost a lot and if your not an active player, will probably require you to buy gems and
                convert them into gold.</p>
            <p> The only special thing to do is to get the Gift of Zhaitan, which require you to play through the
                dungeons. Now that dungeon currency is combined it is actually quite accessable, just play through any
                dungeon thats looking for players. Dungeons are easy enough that in majority of cases your group will be
                able to do them regardless of skill. Just make sure to have 5 people.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Usage">
            <header>Usage</header>
            <p>The Bifrost can be used by any level 80 character that is able to wield a staff. The weapon's unique
                visual effects is this rainbow trail effect that can be seen by the user as well as by other players in
                the surrounding area.</p>
            <p>The weapon's skills and damage output are identical to other ascended staff. However, the weapon (and all
                legendary weapons) has the added benefit of being able to change it's provided stats out of combat. For
                example, the stats provided by The Bifrost could be (which are identical to Zojja's Spire (berserkers
                stats)):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>+251 Power</li>
                <li>+179 Precision</li>
                <li>+179 Ferocity</li>
            </ul>

            <header>Notes</header>
            <ul>
                <li>The crafting process for The Bifrost can be a long and expensive process. However, the end result is
                    a visually stunning weapon with unique effects and the convenience of being able to change stats,
                    effectively never needing another staff again with the legendary armoury. </li>
                <li>In Norse mythology, Bifröst is the rainbow bridge connecting Midgård (World of Men) to Asgård (World
                    of the Gods) (from <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Bifrost">wiki</a>).</li>
                <li>Overall, The Bifrost is a highly sought-after legendary weapon in Guild Wars 2 and is a testament to
                    a player's dedication and skill in the game's exploration and gameplay mechanics.</li>
