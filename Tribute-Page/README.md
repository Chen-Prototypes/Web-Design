Tribue page of Steve Jobs I made for the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design assignment. I'm not sure how to fully extend the blue at the header so their isnt any gray (you can still see a small gray border at the top). I wanted to do a GW2 character but finding any timeline of them is difficult (since I don't really pay attention to the story).
