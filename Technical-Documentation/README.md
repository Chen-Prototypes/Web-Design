# Technical-Documentation

This was supposed to be a technical documentation for the freeCodeCamp assignment. I fulfilled the requirements but based everything off the Guild Wars 2 legendary weapon The Bifrost so I'm missing the code portion of the assignment (also am unsure if it even qualifies as a technical doc). It also won't make much sense unless you play a lot of Guild Wars 2.
